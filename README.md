# Digit Recognition for MINST Data set

## CONFIGURATION 

Python version : 3.11 \n
library : scikit-datasets numpy

```
pip install -r requirement.txt  
```

##  Description 
The MNIST data set is a collection of 70.000 black and white handwritten digits from 0 to 9.
The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.

I took a subset of the data set that I split into a train and test set in the following manner :
training set - 10.000 samples
test set - 1.000 samples

Here some examples :
Run the test Code :

```
python DigitRecogition.py
```
